Summary of the first group meeting :(FRIDAY 5th)
Project options :
1-Moving car with light and motion sensors
2- Motor controlled by thermal heat ( Human thermal heat )
3- Fan/ Air Compressor controlled by thermal sensor
The group decided to go with the 3rd option as it seemed the most simple and straight forward with the least moving parts , Once we get the project to work we have the options to add more parts / sensors for other functions.
The most 3 challenging parts of the project :
1- Learning Eagle CAD to to the PCB
2- Programming as all the group members are EE students with little experience in programming
3- Designing the circuit where we can program the Processor '
The budget for the project < $50 per person
Best time for meeting : Fridays at 5 PM
We are expecting to spend 3-4 hours working on the project each week
