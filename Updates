Summery of the first group meeting : 
Project options : 
1-Moving car with light and motion sensors 
2- Motor controlled by thermal heat ( Human thermal heat )
3- Fan/ Air Compressor controlled by thermal sensor 

The group decided to go with the 3rd option as it seemed the most simple and straight forward with the least moving parts , Once we get the project to work we have the options to add more parts / sensors for other functions.
The most 3 challenging parts of the project : 
1- Learning Eagle CAD to to the PCB 
2- Programming as all the group members are EE students with little experience in programming 
3- Designing the circuit where we can program the Processor '

The budget for the project < $50 per person 
Best time for meeting : Fridays at 5 PM 
We are expecting to spend 3-4 hours working on the project each week
